This course will teach you everything you need to know to build a fully on-chain chess game with Unity. The main goal of the course is to demystify on-chain gaming and showcase how easy it is to get started building games on Solana. There are four main modules:

1. Set-up and Solana Unity SDK overview
2. The On-chain logic
3. Transaction building and event listening from Unity
4. Publishing as xNFT and on Saga

Whether you want to dig deeper into the on-chain logic or just understand how to create your custom Unity interface, by the end of the course you will be able to play the same game, in real-time, across all the clients built with this tutorial.
We will soon introduce on-chain logic primitives accessible in Unity to let you create your very own game.

## Requirements

- Unity ([download](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/InstallingUnity.html))
- Solana Unity SDK ([install](https://solana.unity-sdk.gg/docs/installation))
- An RPC provider if you deploy in mainnet ([endpoints](https://www.helius.dev/))
