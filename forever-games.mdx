Unstoppable Games or fully onchain games are games whose state and logic run entirely on a blockchain. There are several reasons why building entirely onchain can be advantageous.

**Permissionless Composability** - Onchain games lower the barrier for **User-Generated Content (UGC)** and **User-Generated Logic (UGL)**. It's very easy for creators to receive royalties or microtransactions for the content they add to a game. When it comes to game logic, anyone can transparently and permissionlessly extend it and alter some of the game mechanics, leading to the emergence of new behaviours that the original developer may not have foreseen. Users become an active demiurge of that world - they are not only playing the game but actively shaping it.

**Trustless Compute** - Blockchains are trustless computing platforms. They rely on decentralized consensus mechanisms and cryptographic principles to ensure the integrity and accuracy of data and transactions. This trustless nature enhances security and transparency, making it ideal for **stake-based matches, wagers and prediction markets** while eliminating all the risk associated with centralized parties.

**Persistency** - games don't need a server. The blockchain is the "backend" and any application running on it inherits its persistency and censorship-resistance properties. This enables the creation of digital experiences that can run **forever**.

**Crypto-primitives** - onchain games are natively plugged in a rich system of **protocols and dapps** that developers can permissionlessly access to enrich the player's experience or to enhance distribution. Defi for in-game economies, identity primitives, global payments, market-driven governance systems (e.g. [Futarchy](https://docs.themetadao.org/)) are only a few examples of what can be leveraged out of the box.

Ultimately, we believe onchain games will unlock a new chapter of play, allowing players and game developers to collaborate in the creation of infinitely extendible and customizable digital experiences.
